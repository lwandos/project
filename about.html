            <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p>We at Yomelela Public Primary School strive for exellence. We aim to create a learning environment
             that is <br>
        current, creative and proactive where students are encouraged to engage critically in the areas of
        foundation learning with <br> 
        the aim of becoming productive participants within local and global communities. 
        We believe that those with the highest <br> 
        chance of developing this world and making it a better place are those
        kids that we pay less attention to. We believe that implementing the right tools to these kids 
        <br> 
        at a young age will make easy for them to adapt to higher education.
